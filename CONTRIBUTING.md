I have no idea how contributing to a project works on github, but I'll still try to explain what I'm okay with.

If you want me to add something to or modify someone/where's description, I'll do it, so just request the change and it will be done. You cannot, however, try to add a person or universe or whatever to the graph, as I still would like to keep my method of sending asks to people or receiving them.

If you don't have a github account and want me to change something, just send me an ask, and I'll do it.

I still don't really know how a contributing is supposed to be formatted, but I hope this is good enough.
