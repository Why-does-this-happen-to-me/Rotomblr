They want to create a third Darkest Day and spread across multiple regions. This is meant to "separate Those Who Can Be Saved, and those who cannot. Those who are Worthy, and those who are Irredeemable." Classic cult talking points, creating an us versus them mentality in which them is anyone that opposes to what realistically is a cult trying to destroy the world. They obviously worship Eternatus, and have a couple thousands followers. The last thing Barbara, the church's account manager, posted was her fusing with Eternatus after capturing it and the two legendary dogs. It has been months since that, so hopefully the cult is no longer active. Located in [[Church of Eternatus's universe]]. [[@messengersofeternatus]]
