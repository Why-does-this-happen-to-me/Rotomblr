A cult that tries to get the world to "the good old days", which basically means getting rid of queer, disabled and otherwise marginalized groups they don't like. They have a lot of paradox shedinjas called iron raptures which can apparently steal your soul if you look inside them. They hope to use them to turn people into bigots like them, which doesn't seem to fully work. They used one in [[Ledi-anon]], a trans individual, expecting her to say she's a boy, but the only thing they accomplished was her cutting her hair and believing her deadname to be her actual name. They seemed surprised by that. The two people in charge of their blog may also be under the influence of the creature, given their, often ominous, responses when questioned about the subject, but the bigotry seems to have been there from before, unless the one we saw in action was weaker than the one controlling them. Located in [[Wonderguard universe]]. [[@the-wonderguard-project]]
