He/They. He was curious about sleebies and found a weird pokeball that hit them with smoke. Now, he is a hisuian growlithe. Lives in [[Universe (maybe) parallel to Jacks's]]. Got sent to the past and now is one of the pokemon in the team of someone called Rei (semi-willingly). [[@hisuian-growlithe-communication]]
