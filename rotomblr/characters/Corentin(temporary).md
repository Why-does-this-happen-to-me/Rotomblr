~~He/him~~ doesn't want to use those anymore, will be changed here when Corentin chooses pronouns, used to be a male shiny jolteon, but got transed after expressing doubt about his gender. Is no longer transed, but can shapeshift and stayed as a girl, which is how he identifies now. Is trying to choose a new name, and an ask has been sent to check if his pronouns stay as he/him or change to something else. His pronouns has been confirmed to stay the same by him. Seems to be some kind of being whose reality is controlled by the information he receives. His best friend is [[Mari]], and he evolved by accident. Given that his reality is always changing, I'll link his [intro post](https://www.tumblr.com/adverse-imaginative/738281282420834304/hello-my-name-is-corentin-im-a-shiny-male?source=share). He can travel to other universes, so I'll link the [[List of universes where Corentin has been]]. His home is a cozy burrow on Route 6 in [[Maple's universe]]. [[@adverse-imaginative]]
