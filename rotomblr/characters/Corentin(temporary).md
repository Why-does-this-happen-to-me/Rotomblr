~~He/him doesn't want to use those anymore, will be changed here when Corentin chooses pronouns, used to be a male shiny jolteon, but got transed after expressing doubt about her gender.. Is no longer transed, but can shapeshift and stayed as a girl, which is how she identifies now.~~ Likes people using she/her for her. Is trying to choose a new name, ~~and an ask has been sent to check if her pronouns stay as he/him or change to something else.~~ Seems to be some kind of being whose reality is controlled by the information she receives. Her best friend is [[Mari]], and she evolved by accident. Given that her reality is always changing, I'll link her [intro post](https://www.tumblr.com/adverse-imaginative/738281282420834304/hello-my-name-is-corentin-im-a-shiny-male?source=share). She can travel to other universes, so I'll link the [[List of universes where Corentin has been]]. Her home is a cozy burrow on Route 6 in [[Maple's universe]]. [[@adverse-imaginative]]
