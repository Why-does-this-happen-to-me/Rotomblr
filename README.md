# Rotomblr Multiverse Graph

This github repository contains every universe on rotomblr, as well as their inhabitants, catalogued by [@rotomblr-multiverse-cataloguer](https://www.tumblr.com/rotomblr-multiverse-cataloguer) on tumblr.

This repository is separated in different folders located in the one named rotomblr:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Folder</th>
<th>Use</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<td>accounts</td>
<td>You can mostly ignore this one, it just
  
 contains the names of the rotomblr accounts</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>characters</td>
<td>The main part of the graph.

These connect  everything and have some basic info*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>universes</td>
<td>What universe it is, if it has rotomblr and some basic info</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>events</td>
<td>I'm working with the possibility of documenting certain events**</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

*Some characters, even thought it's just Arceus right now, will have a number next to their name to distinguish them from others, as they are stablished characters with muliple iterations across rotomblr.
I would like to come up with a better solution, but until that happens this will be the system used.

**Right now there is only one, mostly to try to see how I could do it. The names of all participants in the event have a // next to them so the nodes won't connect in the graph to keep it cleaner.
 If you wanted to look at it in Obsidian, just remove them and hover over the event node to highlight the nodes and edges related to that event.
