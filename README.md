# Rotomblr Multiverse Graph

This github repository contains every universe on rotomblr, as well as their inhabitants, catalogued by [@rotomblr-multiverse-cataloguer](https://www.tumblr.com/rotomblr-multiverse-cataloguer) on tumblr.

~~If you are not seeing something that is supposed to be here, then it's either that I haven't updated the gitfront thing or that I reached my limit rebuilding with it. In the second case I will have created another one of those things leading to the same repository and updated the link in my pinned post, so if you have the link saved somewhere and can't find newer additinons, that's why.~~ I don't know why I insisted so much on it being private, but it doesn't matter. This is now public, so those problems won't happen again. If you are seeing this in gitfront, click [here](https://github.com/Why-does-this-happen-to-me/Rotomblr) to go to the github repository.

This repository is separated in different folders located in the one named rotomblr:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Folder</th>
<th>Use</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<td>accounts</td>
<td>You can mostly ignore this one, it just
  
 contains the names of the rotomblr accounts</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>characters</td>
<td>The main part of the graph.

These connect  everything and have some basic info*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>universes</td>
<td>What universe it is, if it has rotomblr and some basic info</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>events</td>
<td>I'm working with the possibility of documenting certain events**</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>organizations</td>
<td>I didn't know how to refer to groups and companies, so they are in this folder</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

*Some characters, even thought it's just Arceus right now, will have a number next to their name to distinguish them from others, as they are stablished characters with muliple iterations across rotomblr.
I would like to come up with a better solution, but until that happens this will be the system used.

**Right now there is only one, mostly to try to see how I could do it. The names of all participants in the event have a // next to them so the nodes won't connect in the graph to keep it cleaner.
 If you wanted to look at it in Obsidian, just remove them and hover over the event node to highlight the nodes and edges related to that event.
